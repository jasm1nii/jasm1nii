# hi there!

i'm a jack-of-all-trades creative who just recently started (re)learning HTML and CSS as a hobby in july 2023, and picked up PHP as a newbie in october 2023! my academic background is in multimedia, an undergraduate specialization under my institution's visual communication design program. hoping to expand my front-end coding skillset with time!
